# JobHunt

JobHunt is a web application built using Flask. It provides a platform for users to post job openings and for job seekers to browse these job postings.

The app allows users to create an account, login, and logout. Employers can create job postings by providing details such as job title, description, location, and requirements. They can also apply to a job by submitting their resume and cover letter.

The app includes features such as email notifications for new job postings and job applications, as well as a dashboard for users to view their job applications and job postings.

## About the Stack

The project uses Flask and Jinja2 for the front-end, SQLAlchemy for the database.

## Starting the Project

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the project repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine.

To run the app, you can create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You will also need to set up a database.

Once everything is set up, you can run the app using the `flask run` command and access it in your web browser at the specified URL.

#### Note:

I started this project as a way to test a certain functionality, so it's not as fully functional as I know it can be. There are still some features yet to be added which will make this even better. I will do some of that with time, but feel free to contribute, if you would like to. Thank you
